The Lord has said things in order for us to respond.

Faith is the response of the human spirit to the word of God.

Many people make affirmations without knowing

"An end has come to every frustration in your life"

That implies that there were frustrations prior

I'd rather say

"There's no frustration in your life"

God didn't tell Abraham
"An end has come to your barrenness"

He said

"I've made you a Father of many nations"

He "says those things that be not as though they were"

There's another term for this

Prophecy!

With prophecy there's foretelling and there's forthtelling

With foretelling, the one prophesying is giving a message from God to people about the future.

That's what we read about Agabus in the book of Acts.

There's another angle as seen in 1 Corinthians 14

That covers forth telling

Speaking in line with God's word.

The testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy
