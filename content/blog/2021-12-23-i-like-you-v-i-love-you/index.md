"Four Loves" by C.S. Lewis is a great book.

Theere's a treasure chest of learnings in the quotes [here](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14816053-the-four-loves)

It details 4 words for love from Greek that English lacks.

Language is a vehicle of thought and having different words that address nuance can give entire philosophical lectures in very little time.

You can be in love

Doesn't mean you (as a guy) should tell a girl you love her

That communicates a certainty in wanting commitment.

And not just any kind of commitment.

The commitment of the life-long variety.

You don't use those words lightly.

It differs from the love of God we share with everyone.

In that sense it's actually ok to tell a girl you don't have anything with, you love her. Of course, context matters or you'll get smacked in the face by her spouse.
