Writing is fundamental to the process of reflecting.

Reflecting is really useful in gaining insights from daily experience.

Hence this blog.

I've also been meaning to have an outlet for letting people look into my mind; one that would be entirely my own unlike instagram, twitter and the like that are pretty much for everyone.

People that will come here repeatedly will want to be here.

They won't happen upon my thoughts by randomly scrolling through content "the algorithm" feeds them.
<!-- For my readers, every post will be an event. -->

Finally, I see that writing will help me put out refined thoughts for people to consume.
It's good to keep things brief so these reasons for this venture should suffice for now.

Let's begin.
