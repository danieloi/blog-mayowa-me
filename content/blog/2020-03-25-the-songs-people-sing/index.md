description: Exploring What Makes for Godly Music
---

Scriptures teach to "guard your heart with all diligence"; to yield to the "renewal of your mind" so the right things always flow out of you.

The word of God is the sentry that does the guarding and the renewer that does the renewing.

Godly music is the word of God in a melody.
Yet, a lot of what's considered godly is everything but.

I'll use this post to outline ways these song actually break down instead of build up like they should.

Now a lot of these will just be lines in songs and not the entire songs so they can be salvaged (hurray!).
We won't throw the baby out with the bath water.
On the otherhand, some are so bad, all I see is used bath water.
We'll see what we can do.

I'll go back to hymns from way back to grammy-winners of today.

We'll save what we can and burn the rest.

Should be fun.

Before we begin, understand that music that builds up (edifies) doesn't have a particular beat to it.

Lyrical content is king when marking a song as edifying or not.

The mark of good music is emphasis on the pure, true, noble, lovely, things of good report.

Form and function thinking works in analyzing music.

Form is how pleasant the sound is. Most these days tick this box.

Function is how it reveals the thoughts and intents of the heart of God.

Most do not tick this box completely.

Like I said earlier, in some cases, parts of these songs do and in others they don't at all.

There are a few that are complete through and through.

There are certain 'pain points' in writing Christian music.

One is understanding that saints under the current dispensation are in a different kind of fellowship with God than saints of old.

Not all the psalms of David are sound for a person in Christ to sing.
Remember, David was not a Christian.

Issues also come from people's understanding of the Word of God.

Some think the entire bible is the Word of God but this is not so.

The bible contains quotes from Satan!

To be precise, the bible **contains** the Word of God.

The Word practitioner studies to 'rightly divide' the Word!

You know what applies to you and what address a different people group

Another issue is the teaching that when a person comes into Christ, they're a new creation not a renovation (someone put it like this on twitter).

Think how people identify with the old man in their songs!

I know that's what they're doing because they say things like 'I'm not worthy' based on their recollection of the deeds done in their body.

You share the same body with the old man but you are not the old man.

In the new, we're "blameless", "unreprovable". AMPC says "above reproach"! Uncorrectable!

> You share the same body with the old man but you are not the old man

In relating with God, there's no thought of merit: whether you deserved it or not.

The question doesn't come up!

It's a filial bond. He's responsible for you.

He's kind to you like a parents show kindness to their children. He's not waiting for your performance to be good to you.

If an earthly parent did that, we'd consider him cruel.

Now there are songs that are made by Christians that are meant for the world and not Christians.
Most of the writers don't realize that and that's not ok.

I salvage these ones by projecting their meaning to people outside as motivation to get them in.

They describe a sorry individual who definitely isn't the view God has of the man in Christ.

This subject is given the proper weight when we recognize that music is part of a healthy Christian life.

Colossians 3:16 says the word of Christ should dwell in you richly

> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another...

How should it dwell in you richly?

> ...in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

In song!

My favorite teacher calls it 'lyrical theology'.

The lyrics of a song should pass for a sermon.

When I hear the words 'righteousness', 'peace' 'joy in the Holy Spirit' I don't think melancholy.

Gospel music should be an antidepressant.

Here are lyrics to run from:

## 'I need you'

How many people do you see going around stressing how they need oxygen?

You don't voice needs for things you already have.

You already have God, you technically don't need Him because you already have Him.

Unless you're not a believer then you definitely need Him.

## Draw me nearer

How?

Why?

When?

Who?

What?

I imaging that's the reaction angels have when they hear people with the Spirit of God in them asking God to draw them nearer.

## You still love me

In spite of my failings _sob_
In spite of my flaws ðŸ˜­

Jokes.

In case these writers didn't get the memo, nothing can seperate you from the love of God!

## Make me new

Please new creation, you don't need to be made new.

Agree with the Spirit that you are new in Christ.

They're copying David's prayer where he asked for the God to create in him a clean heart.

He's already given you a clean heart. Affirm it. Hold on to it by faith and your works will declare it!
