description: Observations on how things are in heaven

If no one is sure you're a Christian on earth, it's likely no one is in
heaven either.

If no one knows you're a Christian on earth, no one knows in heaven either.

There's no illegal immigration in heaven.

No one does anything wrong there so people use "kindness" more than "mercy"
when they're expressing gratitude to God.
