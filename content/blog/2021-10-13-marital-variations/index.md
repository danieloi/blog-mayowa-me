I come from a place where minors are married off and men have multiple spouses at the same time.

Rejecting marital variations always came easily for me.

Scripture only cemented my view:
One man. One woman.

Either that or stay single.

Not one boy and one girl.

Not one woman and one boy.

Not one man and one girl.

Not one girl and one girl.

Not one boy and one boy.

Not one man and one man.

Not one woman and one woman.

Not one man and many girls

Not one woman and many boys

Not one man and many women.

Not one woman and many men.

Not many men and many women.

I think you get the point.

## Moral High Ground

Feelings have never been the benchmark for right and wrong.

You know a person is morally poor once they base their morality chiefly on what feels right or wrong.

That’s the first step on the ladder of moral depravity.

Your conscience gets more numb the higher you climb.

You’re not morally superior for promoting marital variations.

## Save the Children

A child is meant to grow up in the context of testosterone and estrogen.

When it’s just testosterone or just estrogen should only be in the context of tragedy (one partner died).

In which case, especially when the single parent has young children, remarrying is good, great even!

## Polygamy in Scripture

You might say, men of God in the Bible were polygamous.

Yes.

They also weren’t always paragons of virtue if you look closely.

Take David, as highly ranked as almost anyone else, who ordered a hit on his servant to cover up impregnating his wife.

With people you look up to, you’re supposed to pick the good and reject the bad.

## Influence

As a Christian, you must never lend your voice to Satan’s schemes.

You must also never keep silent.

I learned silence is the voice of fear from [this RIG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CU7CZUZgdD2/?utm_medium=copy_link).

Don’t tolerate these things.

Satan attacks the family because it’s the fundamental unit of society. The foundation.

## Broken Cisterns

People who entertain strange things like these are usually chasing a high that they can never hit.

> “For my people have done two evil things: They have abandoned me— the fountain of living water. And they have dug for themselves cracked cisterns that can hold no water at all!”
> Jeremiah‬ ‭2:13‬ ‭NLT‬‬

## I’m in Love

Love is not just an emotion.

It’s a choice that’s expressed in actions and inactions.

## The School of Life

Church really is the school of life.

These things are elementary there.

A good one is a necessity.

For E.V.E.R.Y.O.N.E.

## Original Design

Someone can choose to use a window consistently, but the architect made a door.

To be explicitly clear, the clue for entrance with sex is the natural lubricant.

Don’t let sex send you to the ER.

## Go Out and Vote

All this global propaganda because one party was re-elected in 2012.

What’s going to happen to my Superman t-shirt now that they’ve turned him gay too?
