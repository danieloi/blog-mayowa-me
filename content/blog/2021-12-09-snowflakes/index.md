There's a difference between being gentle and being a snowflake

One has more to do with how you act.
The other with how you react.

Snowflakes are easily offended.
Many times the thing that gets them riled up isn't valid.

That will hurt some snowflakes.
They use language like 'your feelings are valid' a lot.

Never pander to them.

Like actual snowflakes there's little to no structural integrity to their worldviews
