The proverbs of Mayowa,  
Son of God

When people sell things at variable prices they don’t consider the mental overhead of bargaining.

If they’d just have a set price, they’d be able to focus their energies more efficiently and have greater growth in their businesses.

Become unreliable.

Yes, you read that right.

Be the most unreliable person around.

People tend to have a poor sense of value.  
It’s said that the mark of a child is this one trait.

A child can pick up an iPad and use it as a frisbee.

When people reach out to me with new tasks, I avoid them like a plague.  
I’m always looking for how to offload a task to another person.  
It’s not laziness. It’s not pride.

Sin consciousness will destroy a person’s excellence.

Excellent thoughts cannot thrive in a mind that’s not established in righteousness.  
They’ll always be choked by second guesses.

Become unreliable.

Someone expressed shock when I said I pay my youngest sister whenever she cooks for me.  
My goal is to teach her value because the moment someone makes you think, they’re supposed to pay you.

Think about this.  
Your mind could be focused on the Lord in worship but now you’re writing code or frying an egg.

I remember coming out of a store and someone asked me to help out with carrying something heavy he bought.  
It was a short trip to the trunk of his car.  
By the car, he whipped out his wallet and counted what looked like 15 to 20 dollars.

That was for less than 3 minutes of effort.

There’s a collective excellence of mind that’s required for pleasantness and peace to permeate a society.

It’s tied inextricably to righteousness.

Once a person sees themselves as the arbiter of right and wrong by virtue of their association with the Lord, they’ll always excel in judgement.

They’ll set the pace of righteous judgement in their society.

The heart that’s submitted to the Spirit of God without any consciousness of the ability to fall into error is a heart that is living the Lord’s dream.

It’s crucial to stay away from people that term you proud for being this way.

There are many that have lied to themselves so frequently and for so long that they no longer reason properly.

Yet, it’s crucial that no root of bitterness take root in your heart because of these ones that have taken this route.

The Spirit taught me all these things by my association with pastor Chris.

I’ll never forget that.

Take note of the things you’ve learned from ministry gifts He’s given you at different points in time.

In most people’s minds, humility is no different from humiliation.

By their understanding, a humble person is the one that bears under people’s pride.

From these observations I see what John meant by the whole world lies in darkness.

A part of Christian discipline is not guilt-tripping people.  
Especially those in Christ.

Someone came late to an event.

Assume they know they’re late and don’t stress it.  
Many people like looking for apologies.

Preaching properly will change their way of thinking and if they don’t see the value and wisdom of what you’re saying, do as Jesus said and pat down the dust from that city as you move on to the next one.

It’s good to be reminded of the things you’ve learned. It’s also key to trust the Lord, that when applicable, the knowledge from the lessons will rise within your consciousness and you’ll act in line.

I give the example of when some people prayed in a manner I knew to be wrong.

On my inside, the precise why for not going along with it had not come forward.

A few seconds later, it did.

That’s part of the ministry of the Spirit in a believer.

Some move around with their heads down.
And I can see why.

I now understand why David called Him the lifter up of his head.

Now my chin is high and my shoulders are squared. I’m never intimidated.

This doesn’t mean I don’t have honor.

Many think that not shrinking in their presence means you don’t honor them.

This is twisted as well.

There is no such thing as blind loyalty.

Loyalty is a rational thing.

I’m loyal to Christ because He’s worthy of my loyalty:  
He’s aligned with Truth and always looks out for what’s best for me.

Lower the friction it takes to get started on whatever it is you’re doing.

Get a faster computer.
Get a faster phone.  
As much as possible don’t manage.

Limit the sources of the content you consume.  
Find the thought leaders around what interests you and follow them.  
Become a thought leader in your niche.  
For this to happen, you'll need to put out content.

Understand that nothing outside the Lord is designed to make you happy.

Most times self-help doesn’t help.

It’s because it’s essentially giving a man fish instead of teaching him to fish.

It’s better to have the person get acquainted with the person of the Spirit so he can fish for himself.

Otherwise you breed the sort of people that don’t see value in what is being said unless every sentence is punctuated with a qualifier.

They’d respond to a statement like:

_“don’t live according to people’s emergencies”_

with:

_“that’s so selfish, you mean you never respond to emergencies?”_
