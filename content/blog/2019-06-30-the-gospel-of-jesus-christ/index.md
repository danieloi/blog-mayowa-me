The Gospel.

Greek _euangelion_.

It means good news.

What is the good news?

That my experience in life has shown me how I fall short all the time.

In my mind is a standard of righteousness I try to follow.

Every time I've tried to keep said standard, I've faltered on different occasions.

On the other hand, life for me was a nihilistic sick joke.

You're telling me that I was born to go through "the human experience" and die and that's the end?

Then why does anything matter?

Enter the good news:

God came into this world as the man Jesus and said anyone that believes in Him as such will have a new heart placed in him by God.

Not only that but He says that everyone who believes will also get the same immortality He has as God and be His offspring forever.

He does all this by coming to live in the heart of all those who believe.

The criteria for His entrance is to believe in Him.

When you believe in a person, you believe their words.

You can't look at a person you say you believe in and then turn and say:  
_"I don't believe a word you ever say"_

Or say you believe in a person and turn and say:  
_"I don't think it's possible to hear what you're saying"_

He has spoken through this message.

The first people to believe and receive all He's said have journalled all that pertains to it and left it for the whole world to believe.

All who believe this thing belong to the family of God.

We have the same heart and so have the same thought processes.

We have what scripture calls the mind of Christ.

That's why we Christians agree on these points.

We know that we're a part of the new humanity: the body of Christ.

There's only one body of Christ.

A person is added with every affirmation of faith in these words.

We are the ones that live with eternity on our insides daily.

We are individuals with unique spirits that are linked to each other by one spirit: the Spirit of Christ.

We understand that He came into our spirits to form an inseperable oneness with us.

We know God and know that we know Him and that He sees us as His children.

We know that faith in this message we preach is the only way to have this state of knowledge.

No other message or any other arrangement of words addresses this matter of the knowledge of God.

No other message offers as much or as tangible a hope.

We know the man Jesus had to die to purchase access to these blessings for every one who would believe. We know He rose again from the dead with a physical body, never to die again to demonstrate His ability to cause anyone to live forever in a physical body; to demonstrate that He had conquered sin and death: the all-time conquerors of mankind.
And to call everyone everywhere through His body to share in this victory till He returns and does away with all sin and death and all those who rejected this deliverance from sin and death on the last day.

By accepting these words as true, you become a part of the completeness of Him that fills everything in everything: the Church of Jesus Christ.
