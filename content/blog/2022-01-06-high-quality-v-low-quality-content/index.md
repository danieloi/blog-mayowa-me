In the physical world, not all foods have the same amount of nutrition in them.
It's the same with the mental world.

Instagram and social media are mental carbs

And carbs while nutritious, aren't essential to normal bodily function

Books, Audiobooks and educative content are wayyy better.

Books and audiooboks take the cake usually since they try to be complete in their coverage of whatever topic they're on.

Books are curated knowledge

The quality of the curation is usually higher than what we can get from tiktok, Youtube and Instagram

Some playlists on YouTube have that same quality to them though.

Entire audiobooks are on YouTube in fact!

Things like that differentiate it from other video-sharing platforms.

In fact, a steady source of content for a self-development YouTube channel would be on major book releases that happen every year. You'd never run out of videos to make!

Videos can help remind you of what you've learned from books though so they have their place in the world.

Also, timelessness matters.

Any book that comes up over and over again usually has something to it.

It might be a what not to do book like say the Marxist Manifesto or something (Haven't read that one).

On that note, I've decided to read my Bible in one year this year.

Didn't finish it last year but I'd say I was 93% of the way through it.

I have a routine of listening to audio content while I shower.

When I had a commute, I covered more audiobooks than I do right now.

Same for when I worked at a physical office.
Covered a lot of video podcasts then.

But life is in phases and that's ok.

I'm doing the Bible right now and perhaps when I get ahead of schedule enough in it, I'll throw in an audiobook or two in there.

Happy New Year âœ¨
